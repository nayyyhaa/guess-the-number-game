# Find My Destiny
Can you guess the correct number between 1 - 100? 

It's a VanillaJs app created with simple concepts of -
- Variables

Variables are basically containers for values (such as numbers, or strings of text). You create a variable with the keyword let (or var) followed by a name for your variable
- Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time.
- Operators

JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.

- Conditionals

If/else conditions
- Events

Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.

    eg : guessSubmit.addEventListener('click', checkGuess);

      Here guessSubmit is event listener,
      checkGuess = event Handler

- Loops
They allow you to keep running a piece of code over and over again, until a certain condition is met.
